# dotfiles

My perosnal dotfiles, which store application configurations. Most applications look for dotfiles in the home directory, so a script is included to link these dotfiles to the home directory (~).

## Linking
Execute `lndot.sh` to link all directories and files listed in the `.dotlink` file to the users home directory. Execute `rmdot.sh` to remove links.
